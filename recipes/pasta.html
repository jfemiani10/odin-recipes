    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Make a well (nest) with flour on a clean surface. Add the eggs and other ingredients to the center and gently beat the eggs with a fork, keeping the flour walls intact.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use your hands to gradually mix the flour into the eggs until the dough forms a shaggy ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and cohesive. If too dry, add a little water; if too sticky, add a light dusting of flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the rested dough into 4 equal pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flatten one piece into an oval disk using your hands or a rolling pin.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run the dough through the widest setting of your pasta maker (repeat 3 times on the first setting).
            </li>
            <li>
                Optional: Fold the dough by bringing both short ends to the center, then fold in half lengthwise to create a rectangle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the dough through progressively thinner settings until you reach your desired thickness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the rolling process with the remaining dough pieces, lightly flouring and stacking them on a baking sheet as you go.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the pasta sheets using your desired cutter attachment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the fresh pasta in boiling salted water for about 1 minute, then serve as desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
